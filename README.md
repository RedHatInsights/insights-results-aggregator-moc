Note: it is possible to use single dash or double dashes for all commands.

## Accessing results

### Settings for localhost

```
ADDRESS=localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2
```

### Basic endpoints

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/groups
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/content
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/organizations
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/clusters
```

### Rule content

Returns rule content and also group info:

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/content
```

An example of response (shortened):

```
{
  "content": [
    {
      "plugin": {
        "name": "",
        "node_id": "",
        "product_code": "",
        "python_module": "foo.bar.baz"
      },
  ],
  "groups": [
    {
      "title": "Performance",
      "description": "High utilization, proposed tuned profiles, storage issues",
      "tags": [
        "performance"
      ]
    },
  ],
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Groups

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/groups
```

An example of response (further formatted by `jq`):

```
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "title": "Security",
      "description": "Issues related to certificates, user management, security groups, specific port usage, storage permissions, usage of kubeadmin account, exposed keys etc.",
      "tags": [
        "security"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Fault Tolerance",
      "description": "Load balancer issues, machine api and autoscaler issues, failover issues, nodes down, cluster api/cluster provider issues.",
      "tags": [
        "fault_tolerance"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Performance",
      "description": "High utilization, proposed tuned profiles, storage issues",
      "tags": [
        "performance"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Service Availability",
      "description": "Operator degraded, missing functionality due to misconfiguration or resource constraints.",
      "tags": [
        "service_availability"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Clusters per organization

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/organizations/11789772/clusters
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/organizations/11940171/clusters
```

### Report for organization + cluster

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/report/11789772/34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266
```

or alternatively

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/clusters/11789772/34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266/report
```

In this case `11789772` is organization ID and `34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266` is cluster ID

### Report for one particular cluster

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/report/34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266
```

### Getting report for several clusters

List of clusters has to be provided in payload in JSON format:

```
curl -k -v $ADDRESS/clusters -d @cluster_list.json
```

Format of the payload:

```json
{
        "clusters" : [
                "34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266",
                "74ae54aa-6577-4e80-85e7-697cb646ff37",
                "a7467445-8d6a-43cc-b82c-7007664bdf69",
                "ee7d2bf4-8933-4a3a-8634-3328fe806e08"
        ]
}
```

Format of response:

```json
{
        "clusters": [
                "34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266",
                "74ae54aa-6577-4e80-85e7-697cb646ff37",
                "a7467445-8d6a-43cc-b82c-7007664bdf69",
                "ee7d2bf4-8933-4a3a-8634-3328fe806e08"
        ],
        "errors": null,
        "reports": {
                "34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266": {
                        "report": {
                            // ...
                            // ...
                            // ...
                        }
                }
        },
        "generated_at": "2020-08-11T10:17:29Z"
}
```

Response format in case it is not possible to return result for some cluster:

```json
{
        "clusters": [
                "ee7d2bf4-8933-4a3a-8634-3328fe806e08"
        ],
        "errors": [
                "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        ],
        "reports": {
                "ee7d2bf4-8933-4a3a-8634-3328fe806e08": {
                        "report": {
                                "data": [
                                    // ...
                                    // ...
                                    // ...
                                ]
                        },
                        "status": "ok"
                }
        },
        "generated_at": "2020-08-11T10:17:29Z"

```

**Mnemotechnic**: `c` means "changing"

### List of clusters that return improper results and/or failure

```
ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000xxx'
```

Returns HTTP code xxx taken directly from the last three digits of cluster ID.
It means that devels/testers could use this functionality to check the
behaviour on client side.

**Mnemotechnic**: `f` means "failure"

Example:

```
ADDRESS=localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2

clusters="ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000200
ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000201
ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000404
ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000405
ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000201"

for cluster in $clusters
do
    curl -k -v $ADDRESS/report/${cluster}
done
```

## List of clusters hitting specified rule

```
curl 'localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/rule/ccx_rules_ocp.external.rules.nodes_requirements_check.report|NODES_MINIMUM_REQUIREMENTS_NOT_MET/clusters_detail/'

### Ack rule with specified justification

Acknowledges (and therefore hides) a rule from view in an account. If there's
already an acknowledgement of this rule by this account, then return that.
Otherwise, a new ack is created.

#### Ack new rule

Request to the service:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"rule_id":"foo|bar", "justification":"xyzzy"}' "localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/ack"
```

Response from the service:

```

        "updated_at": "2021-09-05T16:29:33+02:00"
}
```

#### Ack existing rule

Request to the service:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"rule_id":"existing|rule", "justification":"xyzzy"}' "localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/ack"
```

}

```



### Ack rule

Acks acknowledge (and therefore hide) a rule from view in an account. This view
handles listing, retrieving, creating and deleting acks. Acks are created and
deleted by Insights rule ID, not by their own ack ID.

#### Ack new rule

Request to the service:

```
curl -v "localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/ack/new|rule"
```

Response from the service:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

        "updated_at": "2021-09-04T20:46:20+02:00"
}
```

#### Ack existing rule

Request to the service:

```
curl -v "localhost:8080/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/ack/ccx_rules_ocp.external.rules.cluster_wide_proxy_auth_check.report|AUTH_OPERATOR_PROXY_ERROR"
```

Response from the service:

```

        "updated_at": "2021-09-04T20:32:58+02:00"

```

Please note that just `updated_at` attribute is changed in this situation.

### Update rule

#### Update existing rule

```

supplied. The username is taken from the authenticated request. The updated ack
is returned.

Request to the service:
